A/B testing, one of the most common control methods, is generally preferred to use optimization in digital and web marketing strategies.

As a result of the important market analyzes of the team members responsible for market research in our team, we reduced the number of alternatives to two, and now we need to make a decision for these two alternative options.

It allows decision makers to choose the best design for a website or service by looking at the analysis results that the Data Science team has done.

Typically web and digital marketing datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, 
Kaggle which is a platform have open datasets shared by accounts  has made this dataset containing actual transactions. The dataset is on the site (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilkeryildiz/example-dataset-for-ab-test), where it can be found by the title "Example Dataset for A/B Test".


Two campaigns were performed by the company:

   **``1.Control Campaign``**<br>
   **``2.Test Campaign``**

As a result, we will perform A/B testing to find the best campaign for the company to get more customers.
